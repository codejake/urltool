# urltool

A simple utility that parses, decodes, and prints URL components.

I typically use it to quickly parse malicious URLs.

## Usage

```bash
./urltool "https://www.google.com/?id=foo#thing=bar"
```
## TODO

- [ ] Add a defang option.
- [ ] Add JSON output as an option.
- [ ] Print resolved IP addresses.
